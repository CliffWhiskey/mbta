# mbta
This is an exercise developed during MIT xPro Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN.

The goal of this exercise is to fetch data from an API and use it to animate a map.

Implemented a function to update active MBTA buses geolocations in real time every 15 seconds, and attached to them their own markers with the bus route, bus number and speed of the bus.  The buses' geolocation to an array and create markers with their positions. I also wrote a function to get rid of previous markers.
